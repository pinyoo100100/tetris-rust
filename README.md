# Tetris - Rust & Bevy

A fully functional Tetris game built with Rust and the Bevy game engine, following ECS (Entity Component System) architecture principles.

## Features

- All 7 standard tetromino pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- 10x20 grid-based board
- Piece rotation with wall kick support
- Collision detection (walls, floor, piece-to-piece)
- Line clearing with row shifting
- Score system with level multipliers
- Increasing speed over time (level-based)
- Game over detection and restart
- Ghost piece preview (shows landing position)
- Next piece preview
- Clean UI with score, level, and lines display

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Left Arrow | Move piece left |
| Right Arrow | Move piece right |
| Up Arrow | Rotate piece clockwise |
| Down Arrow | Soft drop (move down one row) |
| Space | Hard drop (instantly drop to bottom) |
| R | Restart game |

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable, 1.82+)
- System dependencies (Linux):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install pkg-config libasound2-dev libudev-dev libxkbcommon-dev
  ```

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the game
cargo run --release
```

## Run Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Architecture

The game follows Bevy's ECS architecture:

- **Components**: `FallingBlock`, `LockedBlock`, `GhostBlock`, `GridPosition`, `ScoreText`, etc.
- **Resources**: `Board` (grid state), `CurrentPiece`, `NextPiece`, `Score`, `DropTimer`
- **Systems**: Modular systems for gravity, input, rendering, spawning, and line clearing
- **States**: `Playing`, `GameOver`, `Restarting` with proper state transitions

## Scoring

| Lines Cleared | Base Points |
|---------------|-------------|
| 1 (Single) | 100 |
| 2 (Double) | 300 |
| 3 (Triple) | 500 |
| 4 (Tetris) | 800 |

Points are multiplied by `(level + 1)`. Soft drops earn 1 point per row, hard drops earn 2 points per row.
Consecutive line clears award combo bonus points: `50 × combo × (level + 1)`, where combo starts at 0 and increases for each back-to-back clear (bonus starts from the second clear).
